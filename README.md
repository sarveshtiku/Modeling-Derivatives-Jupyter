# Modeling Derivatives

A polished showcase of my ability to implement and compare multiple option-pricing techniques under the Black–Scholes framework.  This project highlights:

- **Analytical mastery** of the closed-form Black–Scholes formula  
- **Numerical integration** of the risk-neutral log-normal density  
- **Monte Carlo simulation** with error estimates  
- **Binomial‐tree (CRR) methods** for lattice-based pricing  
- **Advanced approaches** (Fourier inversion / PDE solvers)  

Each technique is self-contained in a Jupyter notebook, complete with clear derivations, well-documented code and visualizations.

## 🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Python & Jupyter**: clean, modular code; interactive results  
- **NumPy & SciPy**: high-performance numerical routines & statistical tools  
- **Mathematical Finance**: measure changes, risk-neutral pricing, put-call parity  
- **Algorithm Design**: Monte Carlo variance reduction, grid/PDE techniques  
- **Data Visualization**: clear plots to compare convergence, error and performance
